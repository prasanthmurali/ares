As part of our regular portfolio management review process and in light of our decision to significantly reduce our investment in our digital television and Blu-ray Disc lines of business within our. Broadband Communications operating segment, in September 2011 we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our worldwide headcount by approximately 300 employees. We recorded $16 million in net restructuring costs in 2011, of which $12 million was. related to severance and other charges associated with our reduction in workforce across multiple locations and functions, and $4 million was related to the closure of three of our facilities. We currently expect to complete this plan and record. additional costs of approximately $1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2012. The following table summarizes. activity related to our current and long-term restructuring liabilities during the 2011 (in millions):. Total. Restructuring liabilities at December 31, 2010. $.

There were 18 million, 20 million and 73 million anti-dilutive common share equivalents in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income from the Qualcomm Agreement. As part of the Qualcomm Agreement, each party granted certain rights under its patent portfolio to the other party. including, in certain circumstances, under future patents issued within one to four years after April 26, 2009. The term of the Qualcomm Agreement commenced April 26, 2009 and will continue until the expiration of the last to expire of the. covered patents. In addition, certain existing patents were assigned by Broadcom to Qualcomm with Broadcom retaining a royalty-free license under these patents. The Qualcomm Agreement also resulted in the parties dismissing with prejudice all. outstanding litigation between them, and in Broadcom withdrawing its complaints with foreign competition authorities. Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm is expected to make payments to Broadcom totaling $891 million, of which. $632 million has been paid through December 31, 2011. The remaining balance of $259 million is expected to be paid in six equal and successive quarterly payments of $43 million each, continuing in the three months ending. March 31, 2012 and concluding in the three months ending June 30, 2013. We allocated the payment due us under the. Qualcomm Agreement amongst several elements. In 2009 we recorded a gain from the settlement of litigation related to intellectual property of $65 million, which was recorded as a reduction in settlement costs and approximated the value of the. settlements determined by the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The fair value associated. with the transfer of intellectual property rights, as well as the settlement of other outstanding litigation, of $826 million, has been accounted for as a single unit of accounting and recognized within net revenue over the Qualcomm. Agreements performance period of four years; recognition is limited to the lesser of the cumulative straight-line amortization over the four year performance period or the cumulative cash proceeds received. As a result, income from the. Qualcomm Agreement will never be recorded ahead of cash payments received. We also recognized income from the Qualcomm Agreement of $31 million in 2009 related to previous payments made to us by Qualcomm for shipments from May 2007 through. December 31, 2008, related to a court-ordered permanent injunction. We had deferred the recognition of these amounts, which were received during 2008, due to continuing litigation appeals. These appeals were resolved through the Qualcomm. Agreement. Income from the Qualcomm Agreement is expected to be recognized as follows:. 2012. 2013. Thereafter. Total. (In millions). Income from Qualcomm Agreement. $. 186. $. 86. $. $. 272. At December 31, 2011 we had deferred income of $13 million related to the Qualcomm Agreement related to the. initial payment by Qualcomm of $200 million in April 2009. Charitable Contributions. In April 2009 we established the Broadcom Foundation, or the Foundation, to support science, technology, engineering and mathematics. programs, as well as a broad range of community services. In June 2009 we made an unrestricted grant of $50 million to the Foundation upon receiving a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service of the exemption from federal income. taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In June 2011 we contributed an additional $25 million to the Foundation. Approximately $2 million of the $25 million contribution came from Dr. Henry. Samueli, our Chief Technical Officer and member of the Board of Directors, who made such payment to Broadcom Corporation in connection with the settlement of the shareholder derivative litigation as further described in Note 12. These payments were. recorded as operating expenses in consolidated statements of income in 2009 and 2011. Supplemental Cash Flow Information. In 2011 we paid $1 million related to share repurchases that had not settled by December 31, 2010. In 2011 we received $4 million. related to stock option exercises that had not settled by December 31, 2010. In 2010 we received $1 million related to stock option exercises that had not settled by December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 we had billings of $43 million, $12 million and $8 million, respectively, for capital. equipment that were accrued. The amounts accrued for capital equipment purchases have been excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows and were paid in the subsequent period.
