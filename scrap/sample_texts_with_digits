Certain of the cash consideration in the above acquisitions is currently held in escrow pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreements and is reflected in goodwill as we believe the likelihood of the escrow fund being utilized by us is remote. Our primary reasons for the above acquisitions were to enter into or expand our market share in the relevant wired and wireless communications markets, reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market, incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings, augment our engineering workforce, and enhance our technological capabilities. The principal factor that resulted in recognition of goodwill was that the purchase price for each acquisition was based on cash flow projections assuming the integration of any acquired technology and products with our products, which is of considerably greater value than utilizing each acquired company’s technology or product on a standalone basis. We allocated the purchase price of these acquisitions to tangible assets, liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired was based on estimates and assumptions made by management at the time of acquisition. Based upon those calculations, the purchase prices for the acquisitions were allocated as follows: 2011Acquisitions 2010Acquisitions 2009Acquisitions (In millions) Fair Market Values Cash and cash equivalents $ 11 $ 26 $ 28 Accounts receivable, net 12 24 5 Inventory 30 27 8 Prepaid and other current assets 4 5 1 Property and equipment, net 3 6 1 Other assets — 5 — Goodwill 134 336 53 Purchased intangible assets 233 266 136 Total assets acquired 427 695 232 Accounts payable (7 ) (14 ) (2 ) Wages and related benefits (4 ) (8 ) (3 ) Debt — (15 ) — Accrued liabilities (2 ) (15 ) (29 ) Long-term liabilities (57 ) (13 ) — Total liabilities assumed (70 ) (65 ) (34 ) Purchase price allocation $ 357 $ 630 $ 198 UsefulLife 2011Acquisitions 2010Acquisitions 2009Acquisitions (In years) (In millions) Purchased Intangible Assets: Developed technology 1 - 13 $ 148 $ 156 $ 58 In-process research and development 2 - 10 45 55 51 Customer relationships 1 - 8 37 47 27 Other 1 - 10 3 8 — $ 233 $ 266 $ 136 Purchased Intangible Assets Developed technology represents patented technology and completed technology. Patented technology is the fundamental technology that survives multiple product iterations, while completed technology is specific to certain products acquired: both of these technologies have passed technological feasibility. We generally use a relief-from-royalty method to value patented technology, based on market royalties for similar fundamental technologies. The relief-from-royalty method estimates the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset that would otherwise be payable as royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. The royalty rate used is based on an analysis of empirical, market-derived royalty rates for guideline intangible assets. Typically, revenue is projected over the expected remaining useful life of the patented technology. The market-derived royalty rate is then applied to estimate the royalty savings. To value completed technology, we generally use a multi-period excess earnings approach which calculates the value based on the risk-adjusted present value of the cash flows specific to the products, allowing for a reasonable return. Customer relationships represent the fair value of future projected revenue that will be derived from the sale of products to existing customers of the acquired companies. In-Process Research and Development The fair value of the IPR&D for our acquisitions was determined using the income approach. Under the income approach, the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. Significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital, the return on assets, as well as the risks inherent in the development process, including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance. Each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations, the existence and reliance on patented technology, the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility, and the complexity, cost and time to complete the remaining development. Future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs, taking into account the expected product life cycles, market penetration and growth rates. We believe the amounts recorded as IPR&D, as well as developed technology, represented the fair values and approximate the amounts a market participant would pay for these projects as of the respective acquisition dates. The following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the valuations of the ongoing development projects that were in process at the date of acquisition and were capitalized as IPR&D in 2011, 2010 and 2009: Company Acquired Development Projects WeightedAverageEstimatedPercentComplete AverageEstimatedTime toComplete EstimatedCost toComplete RiskAdjustedDiscountRate IPR&D (In years) (In millions) (In millions) 2011 Acquisitions Provigent, Inc.

In 2011 and 2010 we reclassified $3 million and $51 million, respectively, of IPR&D costs to developed technology, primarily related to our acquisition of Dune Networks, Inc., and such costs will be now be amortized to cost of product revenue. Research and development costs to bring the products of the acquired companies to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Actual results to date have been consistent, in all material respects, with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions. Contingent Earn-out Consideration In connection with certain of our acquisitions, additional cash consideration of up to $20 million may be paid to former shareholders upon satisfaction of certain future performance goals. In connection with this contingent earn-out consideration, we originally recorded an estimated $1 million liability. In 2011 we recorded a change in contingent earn-out consideration of $1 million and reversed the associated liability. This benefit is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2011 we do not have any liabilities recorded in connection with any remaining contingent earn-out consideration. Supplemental Pro Forma Data (Unaudited) The unaudited pro forma statements of income data below gives effect to the 2011 and 2010 acquisitions, described above, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the year prior to their respective acquisition dates. The following data includes the amortization of purchased intangible assets, the amortization of inventory valuation step-up and stock-based compensation expense. This pro forma data is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the results of future operations or of the results that would have occurred had the acquisitions taken place in the periods noted above. Year EndedDecember 31, 2011 2010 (In millions, except per share data) Pro forma net revenue $ 7,412 $ 6,971 Pro forma net income $ 911 $ 988 Pro forma net income per share (basic) $ 1.69 $ 1.94 Pro forma net income per share (diluted) $ 1.62 $ 1.81 Pending Acquisition In September 2011 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire NetLogic Microsystems, Inc., or NetLogic, a publicly traded company that is a leader in high performance intelligent semiconductor solutions for next generation networks. The expected purchase consideration is approximately $3.7 billion, net of cash assumed, based on the shares outstanding on September 11, 2011. Under the agreement, each issued and outstanding share of NetLogic common stock (other than (i) shares held by Broadcom, NetLogic or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries and (ii) shares held by NetLogic stockholders who perfect their appraisal rights) will be converted into the right to receive $50 in cash. The agreement further provides for, subject to certain limited exceptions, (i) the assumption of all in-the-money options to acquire NetLogic common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger held by employees, (ii) the cash-out of all in-the-money stock options held by non-employees, (iii) the conversion of all unvested restricted stock units held by NetLogic employees into Broadcom restricted stock units and (iv) the cash-out of all unvested restricted stock units held by persons other than NetLogic employees. The transaction has been approved by the Broadcom and NetLogic boards of directors and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of clearance by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce under the Chinese Antimonopoly Law. There are no financing contingencies related to the acquisition. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2012.
